AFTER the 3rd May 2012 murder of the former Private Secretary to the Governor of Edo State, Comrade Olaitan
Oyerinde, police arrested one of his closest friends, Reverend David Ugolor, as the allegedly sponsor of the
assassination.

Why would Ugolor kill his friend? More importantly, operatives of the Department of State Services, DSS, paraded a
group of youth, different from the police's, arrested with implicating evidence, and some of them made statements
that pointed to the possibility of their involvement in the murder.

After seven months of severe travails Ugolor was discharged and acquitted of robbery and murder by a Benin Chief
Magistrate's Court on 29th November 2012. A magistrate court still handles murder and robbery cases in 2012
Nigeria?

Two different groups of suspects by two different law enforcement agencies increase the confusion. How can the
killers of Oyerinde be found in the confusion?

Oyerinde's murder appears politically-motivated. And will it join the long list of unresolved murders?

Many are awaiting the result of President Goodluck Jonathan's order to IG Mohammed Abubakar to find the killers.
Abubakar was also asked to re-open investigation of other such cases.

· Garba Bello, official of the State Security Service, murdered in Kano in 2010 with his wife, three children.

· Abdulahi Muazu, Head of EFCC's Forensic Unit killed in his Kaduna home in 2010.

                                             Will David Ugolor Get Justice?

We call for justice for Oyerinde, Ugolor and other victims of these unfortunate incidents.
