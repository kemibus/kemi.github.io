Zamfara PDP Alleges APC Holding INEC Officials Hostage in Some Collation Centers

The Zamfara state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the state government and ruling All
Progressives Congress of threatening INEC officials in some local government areas of the state.

The party said that all the results uploaded virtually had shown that PDP won by landslide.

PDP in a statement issued Sunday in Gusau by the Dauda Lawal Media Office alleged that the state government
was not happy with the outcome of the governorship election because it was not in its favor.

The Media office raised the alarm that there were serious issues at the moment at Bakura, Kaura Namoda,
Shinkafi, Zurmi, and Bungudu.

"It is clear that our governorship candidate, Dauda Lawal is coasting to victory in more than 80% of results so far
uploaded on the INEC portal.

"The Independent National Electoral Commission has uploaded 2839 polling units out of the 3529 polling units in
Zamfara State.

"But the information coming to us is that the state government is holding officials of the INEC hostage in the Bakura
local government area, intending to disrupt and manipulate the remaining 5 polling units out of the 189 polling units
yet to be uploaded.

"In Kauran Namoda, Senator Sahabi Ya’u Kaura (allegedly) ambushed the collation center with thugs and police in
his effort to disrupt the collation process. Two people were shot dead by the police accompanying the senator.
INEC has uploaded 246 polling units out of 261 polling units of the local government.

"Our major concern is the Shinkafi local government area where only 4 polling units were uploaded out of the 172
polling units of the local government area. We have learned that the state government is plotting to disrupt and
manipulate the collation process in their favor.

"There is a serious concern in Birnin Magaji and Zurmi local governments. The state government is hellbent to
manipulate some of the results, with the help of some compromised INEC staff and some security agents.

"We frown at the ongoing disruptions of collation of election results and violence across Zamfara as reports from
our men and women on the field indicate infliction of violence and assault on PDP agents and representatives."

By Gbenga Sodeinde in Ado Ekiti

Twenty-three Candidates of All Progressives Congress in the Ekiti state Assembly election have been declared
winners in 23 constituencies by Independent National Electoral commission INEC.

In a statement by the Ekiti State INEC, Head of voters Education and Publicity, Temitope Akanmu, the Resident
Electoral Commissioner Ekiti State, Prof. Ayobami Salami, APC won twenty three seats out of the twenty six seats
in the Assembly while Social Democratic Party, SDP won two.

However, THISDAY gathered that Ido/Osi constituency one was declared inconclusive due to the disruption of the
exercise by suspected hoodlums.

Confirming this, INEC said, "The election at Ido Osi State Constituency 1 is inconclusive. This is due to the fact that
the margin of lead principle indicated a need for supplementary elections to be held in 3 Polling Units before a clear
winner could emerge.

"This was borne out of violent disruption of the voting process in three polling units of PU 003, PU 012 and PU 014
all in Registration Area (Ward) 01."

The commission added that supplementary election would be conducted in the constituency before a winner could
be announced.

Some of the candidates of the All progressives Congress APC who won their re-election bids include; the Deputy
Speaker, Hakeem Jamiu, representing Irepodun/Ifelodun Constituency II, Hon. Barr. Adeoye Aribasoye Ikole II,
Hon. Femi Akindele, Irepodun/ifelodun 1, Hon. Femi Akindele, and Princess Teju Okunyiga of Gbonyin
constituency.

However, candidates of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, in Ekiti East constituency one, Dele Ogunsakin and that
of the Ise/ Orun constituency, Omotayo Babatunde won two seats in the Assembly to defeat their closest APC
rivals.

PDP Wins 25 Osun Assembly Seats, APC Clinches 1

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Osun State has declared 25 candidates of the Peoples
Democratic Party (PDP) as winners out of the 26 seats in the state’s House of Assembly.

The commission also declared that the All Progressives Congress (APC) won only Boripe/Boluwaduro state
constituency, which is the local government of Mr Gboyega Oyetola, the former governor of the state.

The INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Dr. Mutiu Agboke, released the results to newsmen on Sunday
at the commission’s headquarters in Osogbo.

Agboke explained why the result of the Boripe/Boluwaduro state constituency could not be announced by the
returning officers on Saturday, saying a decision could not be reached on the winner by the Returning Officer at that
time.

He added that Section 65 of the Electoral Act gives the power of "reviewing" to INEC, adding that: "It is that power
of review that the commission explored in solving the issue.

"Just like the Returning Officer said, it took us several hours before finding a solution."

Earlier, the Returning Officer for Boripe/Boluwaduro state constituency, Dr. Akanmu Alex, had declared Mr Popoola
Olufemi of APC as winner of the election.

Alex of Department of Science Education, University of Ilorin, while announcing the result amidst tight security, said
Olufemi scored 15,594, while his closest contender, Aina Adesina of PDP scored 14,817 votes.

He said: "Popoola Olufemi of the APC, having satisfied the requirements of the law is declared winner of
Boripe/Boluwaduro state constituency at the concluded Osun House of Assembly Election."

Alex explained that he could not announce the winner of the election on Saturday because there were two issues
that affected the total votes scored by the two leading candidates.

He said there was ballot box snatching at a polling unit in Egbeda College Road Unit 16, adding that the results of
Ada 2, Unit 5 was in contention.

Alex said he had to review the situation and incidents within INEC guidelines and consulted widely through the night
before he was sure of announcing the result.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that the REC had to mobilise additional security officials to the
collation centre at Iragbiji town before the result could be announced.

The 25 state constituencies won by PDP are: Ifelodun, Ifedayo, Irepodun/Orolu, Odo-Otin, Olorunda, Osogbo,
Atakumosa East and West, Ife Central, Ife East, Ife North, Ife South, Ilesa East, Ilesa West, Obokun, Oriade,
Ayedaade, Ayedire, Ede North, Ede South, Egbedore, Irewole/Isokan, Iwo, Ola-Oluwa and Ejigbo. (NAN)

APC Wins 22 Out of 26 House of Assembly Seats in Ondo

Fidelis David in Akure

The All Progressives Congress (APC) has won majority seats in the Ondo State House of Assembly election held
on Saturday.

In the results declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the state, the APC won 22
seats out of the 26 constituencies across the 18 council areas of the state, while the opposition Peoples Democratic
Party (PDP) won the remaining four seats.

Ondo is one of the eight states where governorship election did not hold on Saturday because the incumbent
Governor, Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), will complete his second term in office in 2024.

The results declared showed clearly that Saturday’s election was a two-horse race and a straight battle between
APC and PDP across the 3,933 polling units and 203 political wards across the council areas of the state.

The APC won 22 and lost two seats in Akoko Akoko Southwest, one seat in Akoko Northwest, and one seat in
Akure South LGA.

In the same vein, four out of eight serving members of the state Assembly who sought reelection suffered defeat in
the election.

They include Tomide Akinribido (Ondo West 1 PDP); Favour Tomomewo (Ilaje 2, ADC); Hon. Taofeeq Muhammed
(Akoko Northwest 2, APC) and Toluwani Borokini (Akure South1, APC).

However, four other incumbent lawmakers were reelected. They include Oluwole Emmanuel Ogunmolasuyi (Owo 1
APC/Majority Leader); Oladiji Olamide (Ondo east APC); Ololade Gbegudu (Okitipupa 11, APC); and Abayomi
Akinruntan (Ilaje 1, APC) who is returning for the third term.

Three female lawmakers will be part of the 10th Assembly as the female APC candidates won in Owo 1, Idanre and
Ilaje 2 constituencies.

In 2019, the APC won 23 seats in the Assembly, the opposition PDP won only two seats, Zenith Labour Party (ZLP)
got the remaining one seat, while the ruling APC lost the state to the opposition PDP during the Presidential and
National Assembly elections.

Also in 2019, Favour Tomomewo of Ilaje constituency 2 was the only female candidate, compared to 2023 where
three females won the election.

Meanwhile, a total of 208 candidates from 19 political parties contested the Assembly election to represent the 26
constituencies across the council areas.

Embrace Peace, Accept Poll Outcome, Lagos APC Tells LP’s Rhodes-Vivour

The All Progressives Peoples Congress in Lagos State says alleged threats by Labour Party’s (LP) governorship
flag-bearer, Mr Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, at Saturday’s election shows the candidate’s lack of sportsmanship.
APC’s Publicity Secretary in the state, Mr Seye Oladejo, while reacting to alleged threats by Rhodes-Vivour in a
statement on Saturday, said that the ruling party had no reason to be violent.
"The attention of the APC has been drawn to a statement made by LP’s governorship candidate Mr Gbadebo
Chinedu Rhodes-Vivour on Saturday’s elections.
"He accused INEC and the police of provoking Lagosians’ and warning thatif tonight Lagos State catches fire, it is
not our fault’.
"He says `a lot of places are still under attack by thugs and hooligans of the APC.
"This scaremongering is typical of bad losers who lack the spirit of sportsmanship,’’ Oladejo stated.
According to him, security agencies should note Rhodes-Vivour’s threat.
"Should there be any breakdown of law and order in any part of our state, law enforcement agencies should know
who to grab – Mr Rhodes-Vivour,’’ he added.
Oladejo also stated that the APC was also compiling reports of how its supporters were harassed and attacked
during the exercise, saying "some of the reports are really scary.’’
"Now the LP candidate is playing the victim. This old trick won’t work; discerning Lagosians know they are all lies
deployed to attract sympathy.
"Our party has no need to be violent because we are sure of the glittering credentials of our governorship
candidate, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu who will never be associated with violence.
"We advise LP and its candidate to embrace peace instead of threatening to bring down the roof on everybody. It
won’t work,’’ Oladejo stressed.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that violent attacks by hoodlums disrupted the governorship and House
of Assembly elections in parts of Lagos State on Saturday.
Rhodes-Vivour had earlier alleged that an agent of his party at the polls in the state had been shot dead.
The LP candidate, who said the election process was fraught with voter intimidation and suppression, alleged that
INEC and the police were complicit in the killing.
Addressing Lagos residents in a video recorded at the LP’s Situation Room, Rhodes-Vivour accused the electoral
body and the security agencies of provoking the people. (NAN)

El-Rufai Decries Voter Intimidation, Low Voter Turnout

John Shiklam in Kaduna

The Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, has decried voter intimidation in Saturday’s governorship and state
assembly elections in the southern part of the state.

He also lamented the low turnout of voters across the state.

The governor said although the election was generally peaceful across the state, he received reports of voter
intimidation in Southern Kaduna.

Speaking in an interview with journalists shortly after casting his vote, El-Rufai commended the Independent
National Electoral Commission (INEC) for improving on the election process.

"Generally speaking, the process has been peaceful and smooth except in a few places in Southern Kaduna where
we got a report of voter intimidation.

"People are being asked to vote for one party or go back home," he said.

The governor said security agencies were on top of the situation.

"We anticipated some level of violence but by the grace of God, there was no report because security was put in
place in response to that intelligence," he added.

He said the All Progressives Congress (APC) was optimistic of a positive outcome of the election.

Also speaking in an interview after casting his vote at his LEA Kawo pulling unit, the APC governorship candidate,
Senator Uba Sani, alleged that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was conniving with INEC officials to
intimidate voters and thumb print ballot papers.

                                                                                                    Page 74 of 104

In places like Barnawa, Sabon Tasha, Narayi, Kakuri, Kigo Road, Angwan Sarki, Anguwan Megero, among several
places, voter turnout was low.

C’River APC Guber Candidate Lauds INEC on Peaceful Polls

One killed in Ogoja, four buses burnt in Odukpani

Bassey Inyang in Calabar

The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Cross River State, Prince Bassey Otu, has
given high marks to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) over the conduct of Saturday’s
governorship and state House of Assembly elections in the state.

Speaking with journalists in his country home in Adiabo Okurikan, Odukpani Local Government Area, Otu said from
feelers reaching him from the field, the elections were generally peaceful, and the Bimodal Voter Accreditation
System (BVAS) machine were largely functional.

Out, who voted in Efut Ward in the area, said: *Yes, I have full confidence in the BVAS. If you want to look at the
election INEC have been conducting over the years, right from 1999 till date, even at bye-election, you’ll see that
somehow they live up their game.

"People must not forget where we are coming from, and the type of greed that has been injected into politics. The
fact that our economy is very bad and people are looking at election probably as the only way out, as a result of
that, it becomes a total war and at times INEC is at the receiving end.

"INEC must also be given the benefit of doubt to continue to make sure that they perfect all their arrangements.
There were issues with the BVAS but I don’t think that those issues should be key issues in giving judgement that
BVAS is not working. I want to believe that INEC will continue to scale up with technology and everything to ensure
that BVAS will deliver to the benefit of Nigerians.

"I don’t think there’s a lot of challenge with the BVAS, I went there was no delay. I was captured and the tick came
out and I voted so I believe that moving forward they’ll continue to make sure that things are added that will make it
completely fine."

The election in the state was generally peaceful except for few incidences of violence that occurred hours before
the commencement of voting.

In Ikoneto, Odukpani Local Government Area, four buses in the convoy of a top member of the Peoples Democratic
Party (PDP) were burnt beyond recognition and an SUV vehicle vandalised by people suspected to be youths of the
community.

Also in Ogoja, a member of the APC, whose name was given as Joe, was allegedly shot and killed by a soldier
when he allegedly attempted to tamper with the electioneering.

The police authorities in the state confirmed that they got a report that one person was shot dead by the police in
Ogoja.

Segun James

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has postponed Saturday’s governorship and state
assembly elections in 10 polling units in Victoria Garden City (VGC), Lekki.

The Resident Electoral Commissioner, Lagos state, Segun Agbaje made the announcement when he addressed
reporters at VGC.

According to him, corps members deployed as ad hoc staff on Saturday were hesitant to enter the VGC estate as
they alleged that they were held hostage in the February 25 Presidential and National Assembly elections.

Agbaje said the commission’s ad hoc staff set up voting materials in front of the estate on Saturday but the estate
residents claimed that hoodlums might disrupt the process, so they did not feel secure and could not cast their
votes.

He said the situation was difficult for security agents to contain hence he and his team had to come to the area.

"We have eight polling units here with 6,024 registered voters and out of which 5,624 people have their PVCs," he
stated, adding that two other polling units at the estate’s main gate were also affected. "Eight here (in the estate)
and two outside," he noted.

"After due consultation and further directive from the national headquarters that we should remobilise here
tomorrow (Sunday) morning by 08:30am to conduct the elections, by 08:30am tomorrow (Sunday), we will
reconvene here."

THISDAY also learnt that unidentified persons ambushed and snatched voting materials from INEC officials early
on Saturday in Tuomo area in Bomadi Local Government Area.

However, Delta State Governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, was accredited and cast his vote at Polling Unit 17 at Eghoma
Primary School, Owa-Alero in Ika North-East Local Government Area of Delta State.

He voted at about 9.50am alongside his wife, Dame Edith and their daughter, who is also the candidate of the PDP
for the Delta State House of Assembly in the election.

Okowa, who was impressed with the smooth running of the process and working BVAS machines, appealed to the
people to put behind them the disappointment over the failure of INEC in the previous election to keep its promise
to upload the BVAS results.

                                                                                                  Page 76 of 104
                              Live Updates: Governorship/Assembly Elections 2023

The governor, who is the vice-presidential candidate of the PDP, said, "I have played my part in shaping the future
of our great state. If you have a PVC, you should too!"

Nonetheless, Okowa also commended the security personnel for enduring that the process in the area was hitch-
free and hoped that INEC would sustained the smooth proceess and upload the election results with the BVAS
machines without delay.

The PDP governorship candidate, Hon Sheriff Oborevwori, was accredited and cast his vote at about 11.am at his
polling unit in Osubi, Okpe Local Government Area while the APC flag-bearer, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, was
accredited about the same and voted at about 11.05am his unit in Orogun, Ughelli North Local Area of the state.

There were conflicting reports of disruption of election process at Evwreni in Ughelli North Local Government Area
of Delta State, hometown of the 2015 governorship candidate of the Labour Party and a founding member of the
APC, O’tega Emerhor.

While a serving member of the State Executive Council was alleged to have led thugs to attack the polling centre
and destroyed voting materials in some of the polling units in the community, another account alleged that the APC
chieftain had masterminded the disruptive attack witnessed in the community on election day.

There was yet no independent confirmation of those behind the violence at polling units in Evwreni community at
the time of filing this report even as the security personnel deployed in the community were apparently unable to
stop the distruption or arrest the suspected thugs.

However, some NYSC members serving as INEC adhoc staff and others on election duty reportedly sustained
injuries while at least three BVAS machines were also reportedly smashed.

Consequently, INEC recorded an unusual shortage of manpower in several.places, including parts of Ethiope East
and Amai in Ukwani where voting could not take place at all in at least 16 units as the people refused participate
because only about five INEC officials had arrived with voting materials just one or two units.

In a swift reaction to the incident, the Delta State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Monday Udoh, berated
the people for "taking the law into their hands" and preventing the few INEC officials from conducting any voting in
the community.

He admitted that INEC in the state has been hit by shortage of manpower.

Udoh, who lamented the voter apathy that characterized the entire eketoral process on Saturday, noted that the
people ought to cooperate with the INEC personal that came since the Electoral Act 2022 had provided for
continuation of voting the following day where voting could not take place due to inability of INEC to conduct
election as scheduled.

Nevertheless, the Delta REC commended the relatively peaceful nature of the election and hinted at early collation
and declaration of the governorship and state House of assembly results owing to the fact that there was very low
turnout of voters, so that the electoral officers would have relatively less used ballots to compute the results.

THISDAY learnt that the drop in the number of INEC adhoc staff may not be unconnected with the harassment
some of them, especially NYSC members, were subjected during the presidential and House of Assembly election
on 25th February.

Many corps-members simply opted out of the election duty due to threat of violence, beside the reported delay in
the payment of their special duty allowance, alongside policemen deployed to INEC for the general election.

corruption and associated ills.

"Our importance led to the commission being made a member of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on
Election Security (ICCES) which comprises our sister agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the

Laleye Dipo in Minna

A former military Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, has charged candidates who contested the
governorship and House of Assembly elections to accept the results in good faith.

Abubakar made the plea shortly after casting his ballot at the uphill polling unit on Saturday.

The former Nigerian leader, who is also the Chairman of the National Peace Committee, said so far, the elections
seems to free and fair.

"So far from what I have seen, everything is going on smoothly. I was captured within a minute. I hope everything
goes peacefully," he said.

Commenting on the poor voter turnout, the former head of state said he could not confirm emphatically since he
had not gone round to see things for himself.

"I have not gone round but it should be expected because people get tired to vote. I hope it will be peaceful
throughout," he said.

The Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, also speaking after casting his vote in Kontagora, described
the process as peaceful and orderly, adding that the process was very seamless.

APC National Chair Debunks Reports on Zoning of N’Assembly Positions

Sunday Aborisade in Abuja

                                                                                                   Page 83 of 104
                               Live Updates: Governorship/Assembly Elections 2023

The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has described as fake
the widely reported news that the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party had zoned the various
leadership positions in the National Assembly.

Adamu made the clarification while addressing journalists after he cast his vote at his Keffi, Nasarawa State country
home on Saturday.

He was reacting to a news report that Senator Barau Jibrin was being favoured to emerge as the Senate President
because the NWC of the APC had allegedly zoned the Senate Presidency to the North-west.

But Adamu wondered why politicians would be engaging in wishful thinking instead of awaiting the official
pronouncement from the party.

He said: "The report about the zoning arrangements for the 10th National Assembly is fake news. We have not
done any zoning.

"I have said it times without number since Monday. I am still saying the same thing. No zoning has been
established yet and agreed to.

"No zoning has been made public. Anybody who is saying anything is a rumour. It’s a wishful rumour."

Also in a statement titled ‘APC Yet To Zone Key 10th National Assembly Positions’, signed by its National Publicity
Secretary, Felix Morka, on Saturday, the party described stories of the zoning of leadership positions as false and
misleading.

Morka said: "The attention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been drawn to a report circulating on social
media on purported zoning of key positions of the incoming 10th National Assembly. The report is false and
misleading and should be disregarded in its entirety.

"The party has not made any decision on zoning of positions or offices of the 10th Assembly.

"As soon as a decision is made on zoning, it will be made public through the party’s official communications
channel."

The misleading reports, which was published by major newspapers on Saturday, had claimed that the NWC of the
APC had finally opted to zone the Senate Presidency position to the North-west geopolitical zone, making the "odds
to clearly favour Senator Barau Jibrin".

The false report claimed that the decision on zoning was reached on Friday night by the leadership of the APC after
consulting with the President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.

"The decision takes pre-eminence over earlier suggestions in some quarters to zone the position to the South," the
debunked story further claimed.

youths took over the football pitches all over Jos town to while away time.

Some youths numbering over 30 at Dadin Kowa community Jos South Local Government Area of the state, who
abandoned the voting exercise said blamed their actions on the outcome of the presidential election which they
described as disappointing.

One of them, who identified himself as John Datti said, " We came out in large en mass during the last presidential
election hoping that our votes will count. But we were disappointed when INEC eventually announced the results
which obviously did not reflect the voting pattern the votes of the people of the community.

"It shows that our votes did not count and that is why we decided to come out to the pitch to play football rather than
going out to waste our time in the name of voting which may still not count at the end of the day."

Another youth, by name Sunday Igbigbi at Angwa Rukuba football pitch where they the youths also stages a
football match, also corroborated Datti’s position. They called on INEC to learn to respect the Nigerians and their
votes.

Igbigbi said, "I can tell you that many Nigerians will not come out next time to vote at all if INEC’s integrity remains
questionable. So, it’s up to INEC to use this last opportunity of governorship elections to save it’s face from shame.

At Polling Unit: 042 Tudun wada/Kabong Ward, Rukuba Road. Number of registered voters is 3144, accredited
voters were just 500 in number.

Meanwhile, initial hitches were experienced at Rabin polling unit, Du when configured BVAS still carries February
25th, 2023 date when the Presidential polls held.

The Returning Officer said the error must have emanated during the configuration of the BVAS. He returned the
BVAS for proper configuration.

Bode George Condemns Voter Suppression in Lagos

Segun James

As violence and voter suppression are reported in parts of Lagos during the ongoing governorship election, former
national Deputy Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party, Chief Olabode George, has described the election as
a sham.

He faulted the conduct of the election, saying reports of snatching of ballot boxes, intimidation and harassments of
voters is disappointing.

George made the remark after voting at his Cameron Road, Ikoyi, voting unit, insisting that the election was a
sham.

He said, "The attitude of the APC is very disappointing. If you continue like this when things happen, don’t
complain.

He said where he voted was peaceful but the reports he had received so far showed, there were ballot snatching
and harassments of voters.

He mentioned Surulere, Ikeja, Somolu, Oshodi and Kosofe as areas where voters suppression were allegedly
committed.

"What is all this? They forget that the international community is watching. What kind of nation do we want to be in
the eye of the comity of nations?

                                                                                                     Page 85 of 104

"What I found was a general voters’ apathy. How would the outside world look at us because we can’t exist alone.
We will wait and see the final outcome.

"If this kind of attitude becomes a norm, it means we can’t do simple things right," he added.

The PDP chieftain said the presence of military personnel should be to ensure that the process was orderly, saying
"they are to ensure that people vote freely without any encumbrance."

Zamfara PDP Cries out over Arrest, Harassment of Party Leaders

The People’s Democratic Party, Zamfara State chapter, has decried the harassment and arrest of its members by
the police.

The PDP, through its Publicity Secretary, raised the alarm following the arrest of some key members of the party by
the police while elections are still in progress.

The PDP noted that the hatchet job by the ruling party, All Progressives Congress (APC) was targeted at frustrating
the leaders of the party and as well threatening party members in order to ensure that the election process is not
free and fair.

The party said: "It is unfortunate that the Zamfara State government is using the police to intimidate and harass
members of the opposition across the state.

"There is nowhere in the country where party members are being harassed like this.

"Zamfara State government should stop intimidating our members. They have perfected so many evil plans to

State Assembly elections in the state.

Tambuwal made the commendation shortly after he cast his vote at Community Girls’ Secondary School,

lot of irregularities.

"Comparing with the current elections, the situation is highly different from the report we are receiving so far across
the state," he said.

Tambuwal further added that if the situation was sustained to the end, the will of the people would truly prevail at
the end of the exercise.

"The election materials arrived most of the polling units in time and so far no issue of BVAS malpractice.

manpower in the country," he added. (NAN)

Umuahia

The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia State, Ikechi Emenike, has expressed
confidence in emerging victorious in the governorship contest.

"I’m confident of victory. You can see the mood of voters. We are looking forward to victory by the grace of God by
tomorrow," he said.

Emenike, who cast his vote in polling unit 11 Umukabia Okpuala at exactly 10:13a.m, told journalists that he was
happy with the arrangements put on ground by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the
voting process was going on smoothly.

"You can see that the BVAS is working well and I’m sure you can see that quite a lot of people are desirous to
vote," he said.

He advised the electorcal umpire "to ensure transparency and fairness to everybody".

                                                                                                     Page 90 of 104
                                 Live Updates: Governorship/Assembly Elections 2023

Meanwhile, the governorship and state assembly election has shown remarkable improvement on the part of INEC
as deployment of election materials was done on time.

In most polling units monitored at Umuahia North and Umuahia South Local Governments that make up the capital
city, voting started on or before 9.00am.

However, the enthusiasm of voters which manifested in the huge turnout of voters very early on voting day during
the February 25 Presidential and National Assembly polls was lacking this time around.

A senior citizen, Chief Orji Ukaonu, said that people have a sense of disappointment over the outcome of the
presidential poll and it has dampened their enthusiasm for the governorship and state assembly elections.

"People were driven by the enthusiasm generated by the candidacy of Peter Obi and they trooped out in large
numbers to their polling units as early as 6.30am.

"But after the result was announced, people were disappointed and unhappy. You can see the effect today as
electoral officers are telling ones waiting for voters instead of the other way around," he said.

But a party agent, who gave his name simply as Ukoha, said that it was expected that large number of voters would
still turn out to vote "if they hear that the voting process is no more rigorous as it was during the presidential
election".

Buhari Votes, Says APC Will Triumph in Governorship, Assembly Polls

.Asks electorate to vote according to their conscience

.Osinbajo lauds voting process

Deji Elumoye in Abuja

President Muhammadu Buhari has predicted victory for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Saturday’s
Governorship and State of Assembly elections across the country.

According to him, Nigerians know the party "means what it says, and says what it means.’’

Speaking with newsmen on Saturday after casting his vote at Ward A, Sarkin Yara Polling Unit, 003 in his country
home Daura in Katsina state, the President said "I am sure we are going to win, again’’.

According to him: "Nigerians trust us because we mean what we say and say what we mean. We have maintained
that trust. We told Nigerians that we will work for them, and we have done our best in education and health facilities,
and Nigerians appreciate our efforts".

The President urged the electorate to follow their conscience in choosing right leaders, both state executives and
legislatures, admonishing that the era of vote buying had been diminished.

"I am aware that the money is not there like before for people to sway voters, like they used to do. And if they bring
out money now, the people should pocket it, and still vote their conscience,’’ he said.

President Buhari noted that he was not surprised at the results of the Presidential elections on February 25, 2023,
which saw Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu emerging as President-elect, since the APC campaigns were thorough, and
detailed.

The President noted that the APC followed the constitutional procedure for the entire electoral process, choosing a
party Chairman, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, who had served as a two-term Governor in Nasarawa State, and legislator
in the Senate, with an experience that will secure the electoral value and relevance of the party.

                                                                                                    Page 91 of 104
                               Live Updates: Governorship/Assembly Elections 2023

On deepening of democratic culture and rising awareness among Nigerians, President Buhari said the media had
played a major role in empowering people with information on their rights, and providing a platform for voters to
challenge leaders on promises and records.

His words: "The media is doing very well in creating awareness and enabling the right conversation. You can hear
the tough questions for leaders during interviews on TV, radio and other platforms, and the journalists always press
for answers".

Meanwhile, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and his wife, Dolapo Osinbajo, on Saturday voted at the Egunrege
Polling Unit 14, Ward 1 in Ikenne Local Government Area of Ogun State, expressing satisfaction with the conduct of
the election.

Speaking afterwards with journalists, the Vice President said "from here at my own polling unit, it is excellent. The
whole process has been conducted very well and I just hope and pray that this is how it is being carried out across
the nation.

"It has been a very pleasant experience. I am glad that I am able to cast my votes and so many others who want to
cast their votes have been able to do so," he added.

No Police Presence in Most Zamfara Polling Units, PDP Alleges

The Zamfara State Peoples Democratic Party has said that there is zero police presence in most of the polling units
across the state.

The party in a statement through the Dauda Lawal Media Office, Saturday in Gusau, stated that elections were yet
to commence in many polling units in the state.

The governorship elections were expected to commence early Saturday.

Though in some states, concerns heightened over alleged moves by governors to rig the elections by all means
possible.

The statement read: "It is worrisome the situation in Zamfara State at the moment, because elections are yet to
commence in most of the polling units across the state.

"The Police that is expected to provide security for INEC officials, election materials, and voters are nowhere to be
found.

                                                                                                      Page 92 of 104
                                Live Updates: Governorship/Assembly Elections 2023

"The Zamfara State PDP is worried and believes that this is a plan by the state government to resort to extra-
judicial means to compromise the process.

"There is already information of thugs attacking voters in Gummi, Zurmi, Bungudu, Mafara, and Shinkafi Local
Government Areas.

"We call on the Inspector General of Police to call the Zamfara state commissioner of police to order. The police
should be neutral, not partisan.

"It is only the security operatives that can thwart the plan to further compromise the electoral officers, thus making
the falsification of results much easier than it was in the previous exercise."

Low Turnout as Enugu Residents Elect Gov, State Assembly Members

Gideon Arinze in Enugu

Residents of Enugu State appear to have lost hope and interest in the conduct of elections given the low turnout of
voters that is currently being experienced at the ongoing governorship and state assembly elections.

This is unlike the last Presidential and National Assembly elections during which residents of the State trooped out
in large numbers to vote, despite threats of sit at home.

Recall that in some polling units where voting materials did not arrive on time, voters waited for several hours just to
exercise their rights.

However, while voting materials arrived on time today and voting commenced early enough, it was noticed in some
of the polling units visited that the turnout was poor.

At the Central Primary School Ugwuaji and Afor Market Square Polling units, accreditation and voting started at
9am. But only a few voters turnout out. The story is the same across some polling units across the state.

It was also noticed that unlike in the last election when residents stayed back in their numbers to count their votes,
most of them were leaving as soon as they cast their votes.

At the Central Primary School Ugwuaji and Afor Market Square, party agents who spoke to this reporter said that
the low turnout being experienced was as a result of the outcome of the last presidential and national assembly
election.

"The outcome of the presidential election, particularly, was not what the citizens expected, one of them said. " And
that is why most of them have decided to stay back since their votes will not count,".

Some of those who voted in the last election but didn’t turn up for the state elections also told this reporter that they
had lost hope and trust in the capacity of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to conduct free and
fair polls.

As at the time of this report, voting was still ongoing and no violence has been recorded yet.

late arrival of election materials.

they have already set up the polling unit.
"Apart from the fact that INEC officials arrived late, there is no other issue here," he said.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that as at 10am, election had not commenced at the polling unit. (NAN)

Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo

The Governor of Osun State, Senator Ademola Adeleke, has called on residents of the state to go out and cast their
vote, assuring them of safety and security.

Speaking early Saturday morning at his country home in Ede, the governor said:

"You are still at home? Come out now and use your PVC as a democrat. It is safe outside. Exercise your right to
vote and be voted for.

"Don’t be scared to abandon your right to vote. Security agencies are in top form to ensure that your vote and my
vote count. I have issued relevant directives to service commanders to secure lives and properties as we all vote
today.

"I need you good people of Osun State to vote massively. If you love democracy and good governance, stand up
now and face your polling units."

Low Turnout of Voters in Anambra

David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka

There is a low turnout of voters in Anambra State in 5oday Assembly election, compared to the large number of
people that thronged polling centres for the Presidential election three weeks ago.

Polling centres visited in Awka, the state capital, showed near empty units as staff of the Independent National
Electoral Commission, INEC, sat idly.

At Aroma junction 1, polling unit 008, Awka South Local Government Area, as at 9:20pm, only six persons had
been able to vote, despite the commencement of voting at 8:30am, and the swiftness of the BVAS machines.

A voter, Mrs Chika Ndu told our correspondent that: "People are not coming out because they feel their votes may
not count because of what happened last three weeks.

                                                                                                       Page 98 of 104

"It will take a level of enlightenment for people to accept to come out, because they believe their votes will not
count.

"I cannot believe that this same place where I found it difficult to cast my vote last three weeks, I can just come in
and in less than three minutes, I had cast my vote."

Another respondent, a journalist, Mr Damian Egwuonwu, said: "I think it is early, people will still come out."

Officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC opened the various polling units in Minna the
Niger state as early as 8am.

However party agents were absent at the polling units visited as at 8:45am, resulting in polling not commencing.

At Umoru Audi primary school, polling officials arrived at 8am to set up for the election with only about 10 voters
around.

All party agents were absent at the unit, so polling could not start .

"We are waiting for the agents, even if we have one agent we will start, Aliyu, a polling official said.

In other areas, polling started at 8.30am but with few voters on the queue.

INEC Disowns Fake ID for Security Personnel on Election Duty

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has distanced itself from a fake identify card for security
personnel on election duty.
The commission did this in a statement by its National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter
Education Committee, Festus Okoye, in Abuja.
Okoye said INEC’s attention had been drawn to an identity card for security personnel bearing the name and logo
of the Commission with the inscription "Complete Access" boldly written in red at the bottom of it.
"We wish to state categorically that the identity card did not emanate from the Commission. Identity cards for
security personnel on election duty were issued by the security agencies and not the Commission.
"Anyone bearing an identity card allegedly issued by the Commission for security personnel can only be on illegal
duty. Such a person is liable to arrest and prosecution.
"The public Is alerted to this diabolical action of some misdirected elements and to report any such person to the
security agencies," Okoye said.(NAN)

Tension As 28 States Elect Governors

•Lagos, Kano, Kaduna, Oyo, Sokoto, Delta, Rivers, Benue, Plateau are battle grounds

•993 state assembly seats also to be filled today

•INEC promises uploading of results from polling units to Result Viewing Portal real time

Ahamefula Ogbu

Voters in 28 states across Nigeria will today file out to elect governors who will run their affairs for the next four
years, effective May 29.

There will also be voting into 993 state assembly seats across the 36 states of the federation in this rescheduled
governorship and state houses of assembly elections.

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), after a slipshod performance at the Presidential and
National Assembly elections on February 25, largely due to failure to transmit and collate results electronically as
assured, promised an improved performance today.

INEC’s Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu vowed that today’s polls will be free and fair.

Yakubu urged parties and candidates to speak to their agents and supporters to see the elections as a contest and
not war and to "refrain from acts of violence that may mar the elections or compromise the security of our
personnel, observers, the media and service providers."

By yesterday morning, INEC had concluded the distribution of sensitive materials for the governorship and house of
assembly elections to all the wards.

                                                                                                   Page 100 of 104
                               Live Updates: Governorship/Assembly Elections 2023

INEC Promises to Upload Results Real Time

Yesterday, INEC gave an insight into how polling unit results will be transmitted during today’s governorship
elections.

The Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee of INEC, Festus Okoye, while speaking on Arise News
said "the law as of today prescribes a dual mode of either transmission of results or transfer of results."

He said when polls closed at the level of the various units, the Presiding Officer who superintended the polling unit
would enter the scores of the various political parties in form EC8A which is the polling unit level result.

"The PO will sign that particular result sheet and stamp it, the PU agent or party agent if available will also
countersign and copies will be given to them and the police.

"That original result is what will be scanned and uploaded to our INEC Result Viewing Portal for public viewing. Not
only that, the accreditation data that has arisen from that polling unit will also be uploaded, but the physical result
and the BVAS itself will also be taken to the Registration Area Collation centre," said Okoye.

According to him, the Collation Officer will have the benefit of seeing the original results and the BVAS itself and
have the benefit of looking at the accreditation data as transmitted, and the result sheet as transmitted from the
polling unit.

"That is the dual mode which the law has prescribed for the commission and that is the mode that we’re going to
use for the purpose of this election," said Okoye.

Speaking on real-time IREV delivery on Saturday, Okoye said results would be transmitted as soon as the polls
closed from various polling units.

"The commission is determined to improve on its previous performance. What we have done is to learn valuable
lessons from previous elections that we conducted, and we’re going to put those lessons into our planning purposes
and processes, and into our deployment purposes," Okoye said.

On INEC’s readiness, he said, "In all the states of the federation, both the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System
machines and all the sensitive election materials have left the Central Bank and the various state offices of the
federation.

"We want to ensure that all polling units open on time. Secondly, we made sure that we reconfigured all the BVAS
that will be used for this particular election in terms of making sure that the BVAS perform optimally and also
making sure that some of the challenges we had in the previous elections do not reoccur."

Police Pledge Tight Security

The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, is deploying over 400,000 officers and men for today’s operation.

Baba, who urged voters to come out and vote without fear, promised tight security.

He has also ordered the restriction of all forms of vehicular movement on roads, waterways, and other forms of
transportation, from 12 am to 6 pm on Saturday in all states where elections will be conducted.

Baba said those on essential services such as officials of INEC, electoral observers, accredited media and
observers, ambulances responding to medical emergencies, firefighters, amongst others are exempted from the
restriction.

He noted that the directive excludes the Federal Capital Territory, as no election is being conducted therein.

The IGP reiterated the ban on all security aides to VIPs and escorts from accompanying their principals and
politicians to polling booths and collation centres during the election.

                                                                                                   Page 101 of 104
                               Live Updates: Governorship/Assembly Elections 2023

State-established and owned security outfits/organizations, quasi-security units, and privately-owned guard and
security outfits are also barred from participating in election security management.

The IGP has also extended additional human and logistic support to police commands and formations across the
country for effective election security management today.

The additional support includes the deployment of personnel, operational vehicles, non-lethal weapons, personal
protective equipment (body armour), and anti-riot equipment among others.

Gubernatorial Battlegrounds

Abia State

It’s a three-horse race in God’s own State. Incumbent Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of the PDP is pushing for his
former Chief of Staff, Okey Ahiwe to succeed him.

This appears to be in danger because of Ikpeazu’s poor performance in the last eight years.

The bad situation is at a boiling point in this state. Teachers and civil servants are owed backlog of salaries,
pensioners not paid, tertiary institutions losing accreditation, and all forms of development arrested, while political
office holders and their families flourish.

This anger of the masses has already claimed the ambition of the Ikpeazu who desired to retire to the Senate but
was trounced at the polls.

The PDP has Alex Otti of the LP and Ikechi Emmenike of the APC to contend with. The LP has upset the apple cart
in several states and Otti who is riding the crest of the euphoria appears set to clinch the prize in Abia State.
Emmenike of the APC will no doubt give him a good fight. It’s too close to call here.

Enugu State

The state parades an array of strong contestants with front runners being Peter Mbah of PDP, Chijioke Edeoga of
Labour Party and Frank Nweke of APGA.

Mbah enjoys a broad spectrum of support from political bigwigs in the state and with the state treasury at his
disposal, being the candidate of the sitting governor and the state being a PDP state for long, Mbah who also
parades a personal war chest will give a good fight.

However, Edeoga of the Labour Party might ride on the back of the tsunami sweeping through the political space,
added to the sympathy of having their senatorial candidate murdered, to clinch the coveted seat, especially as the
Labour Party is wearing the messianic toga now.

Frank Nweke, who even some "Obidients" favour because of his past records, is also a strong contender which also
makes the state a battleground, especially as the state is known for its violent disposition of some old politicians.
Allegations of arms stockpiling is already rife and it will be a tough fight between PDP struggling to retain the state
and LP/APGA bent on wresting it from them.

Kano State

This is an APC state with a gladiator in the person of Rabiu Kwankwaso that has moved to the New Nigeria
Peoples Party (NNPP) and Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of APC, though none of them is on the ballot.

While Kwankwaso who swept the presidential ballot in Kano is supporting Abba Yusuf, Ganduje is backing Yusuf
Gawuna.

The candidates of the governor and Kwankwaso are not only contesting but there is an ego war of who has the
bragging rights over the state. Kano State is too close to call. The prize can go either way.

                                                                                                  Page 102 of 104
                               Live Updates: Governorship/Assembly Elections 2023

Benue State

There is a marked departure from the past as a Catholic Priest, Father Hyacinth Alia, contesting under the APC,
survived all intrigues to hold on to the ticket, while Herman Hembe latching on to the Labour Party’s acceptance to
struggle to be elected governor to succeed Samuel Ortom, one of the G5 governors that bloodied the nose of their
party over power shift to the South.

Ortom, who lost his senatorial election, would strive to ensure his candidate of the PDP, Titus Uba wins, so there
won’t be a double loss of his seat and that of his successor. Allegations of arming youths to steal mandates are rife
in Benue. It’s a three-horse race here and too close to call.

Ebonyi State

Since Governor Dave Umahi moved over to the APC on account of complaints of inequity in PDP, Ebonyi was
suddenly racked by spates of violence and the governor is one to ram through his wish on issues of interest.

So, it is expected that he may, against all odds, do everything he can to deliver Mr. Francis Nwifuru to succeed him.

Umahi however has Chief Francis Odii of the PDP to contend with in a predominantly PDP State before Umahi
jumped ship.

On the shadows to spring surprises might be Labour Party’s candidate, Chief Edward Nkwegu who is riding on the
back of Peter Obi and his Obidients. As usual, violence will make or mar the outcome of the contest. Nwifuru of the
APC may pick this ticket.

Rivers State

Old rivalries have been rekindled as former governor Rotimi Amaechi and incumbent Governor Nyesom Wike have
squared up again with their support for candidates of their parties and brickbats are flying, often leaving issues to
attack personalities.

Wike is pushing Similaye Fubara for his party, PDP, which he had campaigned vigorously against in the presidential
election over the sharing of party positions, while Amaechi came back in full force leading the campaigns for APC,
which fortune had dwindled with exit of many members over choice of candidates, with his candidate, Tonye Cole.

The presidential election saw a lot of violence when their direct interests were not at stake, and this signposts what
will happen today. Candidates were attacked with dynamites and guns during campaigns so worse would be
expected today as Wike will struggle to break the jinx of Rivers State governors not being able to determine their
successors.

Senator Magnus Abe of Social Democratic Party (SDP) is also in the race and can make the contest to go
anyplace.

Oyo State

It is going to be a straight battle between incumbent Seyi Makinde of PDP and Teslim Folarin of APC.

Makinde, being a G5 member that dared the party, is not enjoying the backing of some of Oyo PDP big wigs.

Even with being an incumbent, with some of the parties collapsing their structure for him, Makinde still does not
have that edge. Folarin is looking good for the Oyo State governorship.

Plateau State

With Governor Simon Lalong’s failure to grab his senatorial seat, his quest to determine who takes over from him
has become a serious agenda.

                                                                                                      Page 103 of 104
                                Live Updates: Governorship/Assembly Elections 2023

So far, his candidate, Dr. Nantwe Yilwada of the APC has Caleb Muftwang of PDP and Yohanna Margif of Labour
Party to slug it out with, given their performances during the presidential elections. Margif has been bogged down
by court orders which were cleared a few days ago.

With the backing of the incumbent governor, APC will strive to retain the state which has been a core PDP state till
Lalong took it to APC.

Also, the general acceptance of the Labour Party in Plateau and the performance of its presidential candidate in the
last election may throw up some upsets in favour of the Labour Party. Muftwang looks determined to return Plateau
to the PDP. But anything can still happen in Plateau State today.

Lagos State

The loss of Lagos by the APC to little known LP in the Presidential election threw up a gamut of variables which
sent strategists hurrying back to the drawing board.

Whereas Lagos was seen as tug of war between the APC and their usual PDP, what could be a rib excised from
PDP ended up causing an upset that has made the poster boy of Lagos, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to start
losing sleep due to the possibility of Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour of the LP upstaging him.

This factor has seen a flurry of activities in churches, football stunts and visits to places that ordinarily would not be
contemplated.

Later statements by Rhodes-Vivour that he was going to open the account books of Lagos for people to see how
funds of the state had been applied will definitely lead to a do or die contest. Moreso, when it comes with the threat
that may smear reputations. The heat is already on in the state with threats of Oro cult and warnings to non-
Yorubas not to rock the boat.

Delta State

As for Delta State, apart from being the sitting Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa was also Atiku’s running mate, and the
least expected from him was to deliver maximum votes in the Presidential election. However, he managed to garner
161,600 votes, trailing the LP by a distance.

Okowa will be fighting today to take his preferred candidate, Sheriff Oborevwori, to the Delta State Government
House, Asaba.

Apart from the rising popularity of the Labour Party, Okowa also has the candidate of the APC and Deputy Senate
President, Ovie Omo-Agege to contend with.

With PDP chieftains, including the former governor of the state, James Ibori, and Senator James Manager both
working at cross purposes with the Okowa administration, it would be interesting to see which of the parties have
the last laugh today. It’s a three-horse here.

Sokoto State

Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State may have won the North-west state for Atiku and his PDP in the
February 25 presidential election. Yet, a dark cloud of uncertainty hangs over the governorship election. Today’s
voting will be a keenly contested poll between Saidu Umar of the PDP and the APC’s Ahmad Aliyu. The race is too
close to call in Sokoto State.

Kaduna State

In Kaduna State, Governor Nasir el-rufai will require a miracle to determine his successor.

                                                                                             Page 104 of 104
                             Live Updates: Governorship/Assembly Elections 2023

El-rufai and the APC were badly trounced in the February 25 Presidential and National Assembly elections by the
PDP, making today’s election a tough one for his favoured Ubah Sani. Isah Ashiru of the PDP will give el-rufai’s
man a good run for his money. Victory can go either way. The race is too close to call in Kaduna State.
