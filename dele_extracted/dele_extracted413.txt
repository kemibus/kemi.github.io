He was earlier in the day arrested by the DSS at the Murtala International Airport by the DSS and detained on
returning from The Gambia.

Arogundade had taken to his Facebook page to announce that he had been arrested by the DSS.

'He wrote: 'This is me at the DSS office at International Airport Lagos where I'm being held or detained against my
wish.

'I have just returned from Banjul where I went to train Gambian journalists on Conflict sensitive journalism. Ever
since the days of military rule I get molested by DSS and Immigration at the airport. This nonsense has to stop!'

He later informed that he had been released and his passport returned to him.

According to Arogundade, 'To all...thanks. My passport has been returned by the DSS and I'm now just leaving the
airport despite arriving since 3.30pm. I will update further.'
