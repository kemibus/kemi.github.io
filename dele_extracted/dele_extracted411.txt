 Renowned Publisher of Ovation Magazine, Chief Dele Momodu visited his father's rented house at Oke - Ijan
Street in the ancient town of Ile-Ife, Osun State, where he lived when he was 9yrs old showcasing his humble
background. Though from Edo State, Dele Momodu never stopped associating himself with Ile-Ife, as he had all his
Education in that Yorùbá town; including his University Education at Obafemi Awolowo University with a B.A in
Yorùbá Language and M.A English, as well as his NYSC.

Sometimes we grow up in a town away from our hometown and it feels like a second too. Ile-Ife is also the town
where late Tell Magazine Journalist, Dele-Giwa also had his childhood life.

I GREW UP HERE IN THE 1960S AND EARLY 70S… MEMORIES FLOODED BACK AS I RECOLLECTED
THOSE BEAUTIFUL DAYS DESPITE OUR RELATIVE POVERTY. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THE PIPE
BORNE MACHINE FROM WHICH WE FETCHED WATER OVER 50 YEARS AGO STILL STANDING PROUDLY
BUT WITHOUT WATER… GOD.
