Lagos council of Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, has called on the Acting Inspector General of Police, Alhaji
Mohammed Abubakar, to revisit the cases of journalists killed in the state in the last few years.

Chairman of the council, Mr. Deji Elumoye , who made the plea in Lagos, at the public presentation of a book, The
Journalist's Wife authored by Mrs.Ochuko Ohu, the widow of slain Assistant News Editor of The Guardian, Bayo
Ohu, said apart from the killing of Mr. Dele Giwa, the pioneer Editor-in-Chief of Newswatch magazine through
parcel bomb in Lagos on October 19, 1986, several other journalists had been killed in the course of carrying out
their official duties

The slain journalists, according to him, include Godwin Agbroko, late Chairman , Editorial Board of ThisDay
newspaper; Mr Sule Edo, Judicial Correspondent of The Nation; Abayomi Ogundeji , member of the Editorial Board
of ThisDay and Bayo Ohu.

Elumoye said since the assassination of the aforementioned journalists nothing positive had been done to unravel
the killers of "these crops of seasoned journalists."

He called on the new IG to as a matter of urgency, re-open the cases of all these slain journalists, so that the cases
will not be swept under the carpet

He said: "The new IG being a crack and seasoned police officer should prove his worth by calling for the files of all
the slain journalists. Thank God at a particular time, he was Commissioner of Police in Lagos, so we believe with
his recent elevation, he is now more in a position to ensure that justice was done in the case of these our late
colleagues."

"It is our hope that the Police IG will assign these cases to tested detectives, who we also believe will get to the root
of the murders, so that those who perpetrated the dastardly act would be brought to book no matter how late," he
added.
