 Nigeria's military ruler between 1985 and 1993 who annulled the country's 1993 election, General Ibrahim
Babangida, has listed conditions under which he would answer summons by the country's human rights violations
commission.

 Babangida had been invited by the Justice Chukwudifu Oputa to respond to a petition filed against him over the
killing of a journalist, Dele Giwa.

Babangida's lawyer, Mustapha Wali, told a news conference in Abuja Tuesday that the former military ruler would
not appear before the commission until it "created a conducive atmosphere" for his client to appear before it.

He said that "the present environment is not only unconducive for Babangida, but also for the commission."

 Wali recalled that rowdy crowd behaviour at the commission's sittings in Lagos created prospects of indignities and
prejudicial conduct.

The slain journalist was killed in his home by a parcel bomb in October 1986. Giwa was a vocal critic of
Babangida.

Also still expected to appear before the commission are former military rulers General Muhammadu Buhari and
General Abdulsalami Abubakar. dpa aa vc
