Body


 How time flies? Today makes it exactly 37 years that founding Editor-in-Chief of Newswatch magazine, Dele Giwa,
was killed by parcel bomb in his Adeniyi Jones, Ikeja, Lagos home. Time virtually stood still that Sunday, as news
spread of his death. Sympathisers rushed to his residence and the Newswatch office then at Oregun to condole
with his family and colleagues.

Giwa was a colourful journalist. After returning home from the United States (US), he landed at the Daily Times,
where he made the features pages a delight to read. He crossed over to Concord Group of Newspapers to edit the
Sunday paper. Giwa wrote with passion. He threw himself into his job and when he and his three friends started
Newswatch in 1985, magazine publishing came of age. Giwa's forceful nature gave Newswatch its outlook.

'Why Dele Giwa's doctor left home after Newswatch editor's death'

The circumstances surrounding his death remain as hazy as they were when he was bombed in 1986. Who killed
Dele Giwa? This is the question his family, friends and colleagues have been asking since his death. The question
remains pertinent today, just as it was in 1986. The Ibrahim Babaginda-led junta under which he was killed pledged
to fish out his killers. It failed to do so despite the linking of some of its top officials with the dastardly act.

Will Giwa die in vain? Will we continue to ask the question: Who killed Dele Giwa? Or will the latter change to:
Revealed: Those who killed Dele Giwa? For his children and grandchildren, finding Giwa's killers and bringing
them to justice is the only way to bring closure to the matter. May he continue to rest in peace.
