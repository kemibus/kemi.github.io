The International Press Centre (IPC) has calls for justice on the gruesome murder of Dele Giwa precisely 30 years
ago. Giwa, the founding Editor-In-Chief of Newswatch Magazine was assassinated through a letter bomb, October
19, 1986. Prior to this incident, Giwa was known to be an intelligent and enterprising journalist who was always on
the frontline. The Director of IPC, Mr. Lanre Arogundade, in a statement yesteday as part of the activities to mark
the 30 anniversary of the renowned kournalists, described his killing as the most drastic act of intimidation of the
press in the Nigerian history "The death of Dele Giwa, has over the years shown just how journalists could be
endangered.

Many other journalists have been killed, and we must not relent in the pursuit of justice for them, and the safety of
journalists in Nigeria." IPC therefore uses the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the gruesome murder of Dele
Giwa to plead with the President Muhammadu Buhari government to reopen the case, as justice is a very important
element of development.
